To start using the bot you need to add your data from config.ini file

Add your list of names and birth dates to the file birthdays.csv in the format (name,date) where the date is in MM-DD format.

Write ready greeting messages in the file birthday_messages.txt, where each 1 line is a text that will be randomly selected, do not forget to write {name} anywhere in the string where you want, so that in the future it will be replaced by the real name.

If you want, put your pictures in the folder photo_birthdays

After all that is worth running the script, and preferably on some server.
